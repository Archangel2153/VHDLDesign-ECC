# VHDLDesign-ECC

Group:
- Onno de Gouw
- Stefan Popa

---------------------------------------------------------------------

In this project, we have:
- Designed and simulated a hardware architecture for Elliptic Curve Cryptography on Xilinx ISE Design Suite,
- Created the datapath, as well as added a memory unit and control logic to implement an elliptic curve point scalar multiplication,
- Partially implemented point addition/doubling architecture

The project was made for the course Selected Topics on Hardware for Security at Radboud University, cohort 2021.

Note: 
- Parts of the code were implemented by the professors of the course.
- The project was graded with an 8 and thus it is not a complete/perfect implementation.
